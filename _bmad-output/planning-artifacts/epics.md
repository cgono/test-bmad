NFR8: API contracts should be versioned under /v1 and remain backward compatible for non-breaking changes.
NFR9: The architecture should preserve extensibility for future audio, translation, and personal book-compilation integrations.

### Additional Requirements

- Starter template requirement (critical): initialize implementation with a minimal dual-starter stack using FastAPI backend plus Vite React frontend; this should be the first implementation story.
- Establish a monorepo-style structure with clear `backend/` and `frontend/` boundaries and a feature-layered internal structure.
- API contract must use a standardized response envelope (`success`/`partial`/`error`) with `request_id`, typed error categories, and async-ready fields (optional `job_id`).
- Enforce API naming and payload consistency: versioned `/v1` routes and `snake_case` fields.
- Include a request correlation and error-handling middleware strategy to avoid raw upstream/provider exceptions leaking to clients.
- Use repository and storage interfaces from day one to keep MVP no-DB while preserving a migration path to persistent history/artifact stores.
- Local deployment baseline should be Docker Compose for backend + frontend parity and reduced startup friction.
- Integrate budget guardrail mechanics with request-size limits, MIME/type validation, and configurable warning/block behavior.
- Implement diagnostics as first-class output: raw OCR, confidence, timings, and trace details.
- Frontend state management should use a consistent API-client boundary and query lifecycle pattern (TanStack Query in architecture guidance).
- UX requirement: iPhone Safari mobile-first design with a single-column, touch-friendly flow.
- UX requirement: progressive disclosure by default; keep pinyin as primary content and hide technical diagnostics behind explicit `Show Details` toggle.
- UX requirement: provide clear low-confidence recovery with primary `Retake Photo` and secondary proceed option.
- UX requirement: maintain continuous reading loop with dominant `Take Photo` then `Next Page` primary actions.
- Accessibility requirements include WCAG AA contrast, minimum 44x44 tap targets, semantic controls, and non-color-only status communication.
- Pinyin display preference is tone marks/diacritics by default with numeric-tone fallback where needed.

## Epic 1: Foundation & Capture-to-Result Vertical Slice

Deliver a complete, working first path where Clint can capture/upload a page and receive basic pinyin output via stable /v1 contracts.

### Story 1.1: Set Up Initial Project from Starter Template

As Clint,
I want the project initialized from the selected FastAPI + Vite starter template with a /v1/process entrypoint and phone upload screen,
So that I can submit an image through a stable MVP path.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a fresh repo and environment
**When** the app stack is started locally
**Then** frontend and backend run with documented startup commands
**And** /v1 routing is active with unauthenticated MVP access.

**Given** iPhone Safari opens the app
**When** I land on the initial screen
**Then** I can access a clear Take Photo/upload action
**And** submission posts to POST /v1/process.

### Story 1.2: Validate Uploaded Images and Return Actionable Errors

As Clint,
I want image quality and file constraints validated before OCR,
So that bad inputs are rejected early with clear retry guidance.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** an uploaded image that fails format/size/readability checks
**When** /v1/process receives it
**Then** the API returns a structured validation failure
**And** the UI shows actionable guidance to retake/reupload.

**Given** a valid image
**When** validation succeeds
**Then** processing continues to OCR
**And** status messaging indicates progress.

### Story 1.3: Extract Chinese Text from Valid Images

As Clint,
I want Chinese text extracted from a validated page image,
So that the system has source text for pinyin conversion.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a valid uploaded image with Chinese text
**When** OCR runs
**Then** extracted Chinese text is produced in structured output
**And** processing status remains explicit in API/UI.

**Given** OCR cannot produce usable text
**When** extraction fails
**Then** the response returns a structured failure category
**And** the UI offers immediate retry guidance.

### Story 1.4: Generate Pinyin and Return Unified Result View

As Clint,
I want pinyin generated from extracted Chinese text and shown with the uploaded image,
So that I can continue reading immediately.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** OCR extracted Chinese text
**When** pinyin generation runs
**Then** the API returns pinyin in a structured JSON response
**And** HTML output presents image plus pinyin in one view.

**Given** processing completes successfully
**When** I view the result
**Then** completion state is clearly indicated
**And** response shape remains versioned under /v1 with no auth required for MVP.

## Epic 2: Reliable OCR-to-Pinyin Quality & Recovery

Improve output trust by handling mixed content, uncertainty, partial results, and clear retry/recovery guidance.

### Story 2.1: Filter Mixed-Language OCR for Chinese-to-Pinyin Conversion

As Clint,
I want non-Chinese OCR content filtered before pinyin conversion,
So that generated pronunciation output focuses on relevant Chinese text.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** OCR output contains Chinese and non-Chinese segments
**When** conversion preprocessing runs
**Then** non-Chinese segments are excluded from pinyin generation
**And** retained source text remains available for review.

**Given** OCR output is primarily non-Chinese
**When** filtering completes
**Then** the system returns a structured recoverable response
**And** guidance indicates how to retake for better Chinese capture.

### Story 2.2: Align Pinyin Output with Source Text Segments

As Clint,
I want pinyin output aligned to extracted source segments,
So that I can follow sentence flow accurately while reading.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** extracted Chinese source segments are available
**When** pinyin is produced
**Then** output preserves segment-level alignment to source text
**And** alignment data is represented consistently in the response model.

**Given** some segments cannot be confidently aligned
**When** response is generated
**Then** uncertain segments are explicitly marked
**And** remaining aligned segments are still returned.

### Story 2.3: Return Partial Results with Explicit Failure Categories

As Clint,
I want the system to return partial outcomes when full processing is not possible,
So that I still get usable reading help instead of a hard failure.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** processing fails in one stage after earlier stages succeed
**When** /v1/process completes
**Then** response status is partial with usable available output
**And** failure category/code indicates what failed.

**Given** a fully unrecoverable error occurs
**When** response is returned
**Then** error envelope uses defined reason categories
**And** user-facing messaging remains actionable and concise.

### Story 2.4: Add Low-Confidence Guidance and In-Flow Retry

As Clint,
I want low-confidence outputs to include clear retake guidance and retry actions,
So that I can quickly recover and continue reading flow.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** OCR confidence falls below configured threshold
**When** result is rendered
**Then** UI shows low-confidence guidance with primary Retake Photo action
**And** secondary option to proceed with current result is available.

**Given** user chooses retry
**When** retake is submitted from the same flow
**Then** processing restarts without requiring unrelated navigation
**And** completion/partial/error state is shown again clearly.

## Epic 3: Diagnostics, Observability & Operational Confidence

Enable debugging and runtime visibility with collapsible diagnostics, trace/timing data, and ops endpoints.

### Story 3.1: Capture Request Metadata and Structured Diagnostics Payload

As Clint,
I want each processing request to capture metadata and diagnostics context,
So that I can troubleshoot quality issues and review runs later.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a processing request is received
**When** request handling begins and ends
**Then** request metadata (including request correlation id and upload context) is captured
**And** diagnostics payload sections are generated in a consistent structure.

**Given** processing succeeds, partially succeeds, or fails
**When** response is returned
**Then** diagnostics structure remains present/consistent per status policy
**And** sensitive internals are not leaked in user-facing error text.

### Story 3.2: Expose Collapsible Result-Page Diagnostics

As Clint,
I want diagnostics available behind a Show Details panel,
So that I can inspect OCR/confidence/timing/trace only when needed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a result is displayed
**When** I do not expand details
**Then** pinyin output remains primary and unobstructed
**And** diagnostics stay hidden by default.

**Given** I expand Show Details
**When** panel opens
**Then** raw OCR output, confidence indicators, request timing, and trace summary are visible
**And** collapsing restores quiet reading-focused view.

### Story 3.3: Add Health and Metrics Endpoints

As Clint,
I want operational endpoints for service health and metrics,
So that I can monitor runtime behavior and troubleshoot quickly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** backend is running
**When** GET /v1/health is called
**Then** it returns structured service status suitable for uptime checks
**And** failure states are represented clearly.

**Given** GET /v1/metrics is called
**When** operational counters/timings are requested
**Then** structured metrics are returned for local monitoring use
**And** response format stays consistent with versioned API conventions.

### Story 3.4: Emit Telemetry for Optional Datadog-Compatible Ingestion

As Clint,
I want usage/error telemetry emitted in a consistent schema,
So that optional Datadog integration can be added without rework.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** processing requests execute across success/partial/error paths
**When** telemetry events are emitted
**Then** they include key fields (request id, status category, timing, error category where applicable)
**And** schema stays consistent for downstream ingestion adapters.

**Given** telemetry destination is unavailable or disabled
**When** emission is attempted
**Then** core processing flow still completes
**And** telemetry failures do not break user responses.

## Epic 4: Cost Guardrails & Safe Usage Control

Keep the system affordable and predictable with request cost estimation, daily tracking, threshold enforcement/warnings, and input limits.

### Story 4.1: Estimate Per-Request Processing Cost

As Clint,
I want each processing request to include an estimated cost value,
So that I can understand spend impact per page.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a processing request completes (success/partial/error where estimable)
**When** response is prepared
**Then** estimated request cost is calculated using configured rules
**And** cost value is returned in a consistent diagnostics/metrics field.

**Given** cost cannot be fully computed due to missing provider signals
**When** estimate fallback is used
**Then** response indicates estimate confidence/fallback mode
**And** processing result still returns normally.

### Story 4.2: Track Daily Aggregate Usage Cost

As Clint,
I want daily cumulative cost tracked across requests,
So that I can monitor spend against my daily budget target.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** each processing request finishes
**When** cost accounting is updated
**Then** the system increments daily aggregate usage for current date window
**And** daily totals are queryable for operational visibility.

**Given** date window rolls over
**When** new-day requests begin
**Then** aggregation resets/segments to the new day correctly
**And** prior-day values remain available for recent review policy.

### Story 4.3: Enforce or Warn on Daily Budget Threshold

As Clint,
I want configurable budget-threshold warning/enforcement behavior,
So that I avoid accidental overspend beyond the daily limit.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** daily aggregate approaches configured threshold
**When** incoming request is evaluated
**Then** system can issue warning state before hard limit
**And** warning is visible in response/UI messaging.

**Given** threshold is exceeded and enforcement mode is enabled
**When** request is submitted
**Then** system blocks further expensive processing with structured budget category response
**And** user receives clear guidance on next steps.

### Story 4.4: Restrict Oversized or High-Cost Inputs

As Clint,
I want oversized or risky uploads constrained up front,
So that accidental high-cost requests are prevented.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** an upload exceeds configured size/type/policy constraints
**When** request intake validation runs
**Then** request is rejected with structured validation/budget-safe error
**And** message includes concrete corrective guidance.

**Given** an upload is within safe bounds
**When** intake validation completes
**Then** request proceeds to processing pipeline
**And** guardrail checks are logged for audit/diagnostic context.

## Epic 5: History, Reuse & Future Evolution

Allow session/history recall and maintain a clean path to future saved-book workflows and auth evolution.

### Story 5.1: Store Result Artifacts for Later Retrieval

As Clint,
I want each processed result stored with required artifacts and identifiers,
So that I can review prior outputs later.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a processing run finishes
**When** persistence adapter is invoked
**Then** result artifacts required for later review are stored with a unique id
**And** stored record includes minimal metadata needed for listing and detail retrieval.

**Given** storage operation fails
**When** response is generated
**Then** failure is handled with structured category and safe fallback behavior
**And** primary processing response contract remains valid.

### Story 5.2: Retrieve Recent History List

As Clint,
I want a recent history endpoint under /v1,
So that I can quickly access prior processed pages.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** stored result records exist
**When** GET /v1/history is called
**Then** recent history entries are returned in stable, versioned response format
**And** list entries contain identifiers and summary metadata.

**Given** no history exists
**When** endpoint is called
**Then** response returns an empty list (not error)
**And** format remains consistent.

### Story 5.3: Retrieve Specific Historical Result by Identifier

As Clint,
I want a detail endpoint for a single prior result,
So that I can reopen exact output and diagnostics context.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** a valid history id
**When** GET /v1/history/{id} is called
**Then** matching stored result and associated review artifacts are returned
**And** payload shape is consistent with versioned contract rules.

**Given** requested id does not exist
**When** endpoint is called
**Then** API returns structured not-found category response
**And** error message is clear and actionable.

### Story 5.4: Define Extension Seams for Saved-Book Workflow and Apple ID Migration

As Clint,
I want explicit extension contracts for saved-book compilation and future Apple ID auth,
So that MVP implementation can evolve without major refactors.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

**Given** MVP history and process modules are implemented
**When** extension interfaces/contracts are defined
**Then** saved-book workflow integration points are documented in code/docs
**And** history model supports future grouping into book-level collections.

**Given** MVP runs without authentication
**When** auth extension seam is added
**Then** API and middleware boundaries support future Apple ID-based auth integration
**And** current unauthenticated MVP behavior remains unchanged.
